This is a lightweight EEG-based emotion recognition model. A complete documentation will be added in the next few days.
Feel free to get in touch via email: **[2538459687@qq.com](mailto:2538459687@qq.com)**.

The project is entirely open-source and free to use. Upcoming plans include:

* **Cross-subject optimization** – refining `shengji01.py` through `shengji05.py`(/muban)
* **Multimodal extension** – integrating additional signals such as EOG or GSR

If you think this is a good starting point—or even a fairly complete solution—your ⭐ Stars are very welcome!
